This error occurs when using the Expo CLI to build an Android app.  The error message is usually vague, often mentioning something about the Gradle build failing or a similar issue, but without specifying the root cause. This can be particularly frustrating as the log messages don't often pinpoint the exact file or line causing the problem.  The project might compile correctly on iOS but fail on Android.  Common troubleshooting steps like cleaning the build or reinstalling dependencies often don't work. The actual error in the Gradle log can be buried within many lines of other messages.  Debugging requires carefully examining the entire Gradle log to find the true source of the problem. Example of a vague error message: `FAILURE: Build failed with an exception.`
