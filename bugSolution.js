The solution doesn't involve a specific code fix, as the root cause of vague Gradle errors varies. The key is a systematic debugging approach:

1. **Thoroughly examine the Gradle build log:** Search for specific error messages beyond the initial failure notice. Look for keywords like 'missing dependency', 'version conflict', 'failed to resolve', 'compilation error', etc.  Pay close attention to stack traces. 
2. **Dependency Analysis:** Use tools like `./gradlew app:dependencies` to analyze your project's dependency tree and look for version conflicts.  If a conflict is detected, investigate different dependency versions to resolve the incompatibility. 
3. **Android configuration review:** Double-check your `android/app/build.gradle` and `android/settings.gradle` files.  Ensure all configurations are valid and that you are using compatible versions of the Android Gradle Plugin and other required components.
4. **Incremental changes:** Make small changes to your project and rebuild frequently to isolate the cause of the problem. 
5. **Clean and rebuild:** After any configuration or dependency changes, execute `expo prebuild --clean` and then `expo run:android` to ensure the cache is cleared and the build starts fresh.
